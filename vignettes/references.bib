abstract = {By exerting pro-and anti-tumorigenic actions, tumor-infiltrating immune cells can profoundly influence tumor progression, as well as the success of anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells holds the promise to unveil the multi-faceted role of the immune system in human cancers and its involvement in tumor escape mechanisms and response to therapy. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.},

@article{Fridman2017,
abstract = {Most cancers have evaded immune control, or immunosurveillance, at the time of presentation; however, residual signs of an active anticancer immune response indicate a positive prognosisPositive immune-related prognostic features include the presence of specific T-lymphocyte subsets, the absence of immunosuppressive elements, the localization of the immune infiltrate and specific features of its organizationSuccessful anticancer therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted agents, improve the local immune contexture and mediate at least part of their long-term effects by reinstating immunosurveillanceThe presence of either a pre-existing or induced immune response indicates a more favourable prognosis than that of patients whose tumours lack either of these featuresImmune-checkpoint inhibitors have a profound effect on the local immune infiltrate, and a variety of biomarkers have the potential to indicate a pre-existing or developing anticancer immune responseThe discovery of immunological biomarkers in oncology has been facilitated by the advent of ever more sophisticated technologies, posing new challenges to both data integration and bioinformatic analysis},
